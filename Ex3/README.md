# Ex3. Re-implement the sorting algorithm with the same interface of qsort()

Please re-implement the 3 sorting algorithm. If you can implement more sorting function, do it.

- selection sort
- insertion sort
- bubble sort


While re-implement the soring function, you need to accomplish the following things.

1. you re-implementations need to have the same interface as the qsort() function in standard C library.
2. test your re-implementation with Ex--2 program by only replace qsort() with your soring function.


Write a report which includes

1. your learning experience of implementing these algorithm,
2. how to use your implementation, introduce with example code.
3. what is the limitation of your implementation.
